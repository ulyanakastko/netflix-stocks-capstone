For the project, I only visualised Netflix stock data for 2017. The following visualisations are included in the project:

* The distribution of the stock prices for the past year;

* Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters;

* The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017;

* A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs. the Dow Jones Industrial Average price 2017.

During this project, I analysed, prepared, and plotted data. My visualisations can help financial analysts assess the risk of Netflix stock.
